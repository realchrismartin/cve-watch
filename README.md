## About the Project

This project is a collaborative project inspired by a challenge I encountered in operations - specifically, to find a way to manage and track CVE submissions to the National Vulnerability Database for certain dependencies without Dependabot or similar tooling. The recent development and publishing of the NVD's JSON REST API around the time of project inception made developing an application interface that does exactly what I was looking for a no-brainer!

The project served as a way to become more directly facile with Redux as a front-end state management solution as well as to get some more practice implementing authorization in the back-end. Stylistically, it also served as an opportunity to try to reinvent the wheel (again) and develop some manual styling via CSS rather than leverage Bootstrap, with what I'd describe as "mixed" results (in terms of their visual appeal :) )

For a time, I had a version of this application deployed to Azure App Services and Azure Cosmos DB via Azure DevOps as a proof-of-concept for a particular architecture of interest to me - the site is no longer hosted this way, but I learned a lot of valuable lessons from the rehosting process!

### Features

* Vulnerability Search: Search the NVD for vulnerabilities which match one or more key terms
* Software Search: Enter a keyword to search the NVD for software to watch for vulnerabilities, using the CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) lexicon
* Repo Search: Enter a https://github.com/repo/url to scrape a publically available repository for vulnerable dependencies. Only supports Node.JS and Python for now!
* Subscriptions: After creating an account, customize your vulnerability search's default filters to always show you relevant CVEs for the keywords you've chosen to watch. 


### Usage 
This project is packaged using `docker-compose`. You can run it locally via `docker compose up`

For scenarios in which you'd want to deploy and host the application, all relevant environment settings are noted in the `compose.yml` file
