# **Core Functionality**

##### Provided Req's

The goal of this project is to create an online forum about any topic of your choosing in the fashion of Reddit, Hacker News or other similar platform.  A forum is a website where users can login or register new accounts, make posts, respond to posts with comments, and update/delete comments or posts.  For the purpose of this assignment a post is a thread about a single topic, that starts with a link or initial message, and a comment is a response to that post from a single user.  A post is made up of either a title, as well as a text blob or a link to an external website.  A comment is just made up of text.

### Logged Out Experience/Reading Posts and Comments

##### Provided Req's

When a user first enters your website (even if they are not logged in), they should be able to see a listing of all the posts on your site sorted from newest to oldest.  Here is what it looks like on Hacker News.

Since these are all posts, and since posts are made up of either a text blob or links, if I were to click on the title of one would either redirect me to the link OR bring me into the post to see the text blob.  Alternatively, I can click the “comments” button underneath to bring me into the post thread.  An example of a text post can be seen on something like Reddit.

If a user is not currently logged in, they should only be able to read the posts and comments.  A logged out user should NOT be able to create, edit or delete posts or comments.

##### Projected Implementation

We will provide the ability to explore the API[s] content as appropriate, to view supported software and programs. Upon clicking on a software, user will be brought to a view where they can see more details about that software, along with any comments that users have made on that particular software. The current user will not be able to make any comments, or modify any comments, wile logged-out.


### Navbar

##### Provided Req's

At the top of your page, you should have a nav bar.  This navbar should contain a link back to the home page and a link to a place where a user can login or register a new account.  If the user is logged in, the navbar should still contain a link to the home page, but also a button to create a new post, a button to log out and a slightly stylized reference to their username.  The following example is from Redfin.com and shows how the login/register buttons switch to the username when the user is logged in.

##### Projected Implementation

No change is necessary for this requirement.


### User Account

##### Provided Req's

When a user first registers, they should be prompted for a username and password, and they should immediately be logged in with that account.

##### Projected Implementation

No change is necessary for this requirement.


### Creating a Post

##### Provided Req's

If the user clicks on the create a post button, they should be brought to a new page with a simple form that allows them to create a new post.  This form should request the following information: a title (required), URL and post body.  The title is always required, and one of either the URL OR post body needs to be filled in.  If both are filled in, please provide an error and instructions.  There should also be a button to submit this form.  When a user submits a new post, they should be redirected to the comment page of this new posting.

##### Projected Implementation

Users will, once logged in, be able to create comments on a software supported by the NVD through these API's. Given that we are fetching from the outside API, we feel it would be innapropriate to allow users to create a 'new post'. However, commenting will still be allowed on a software, or on a new vulnerability listing, within our application.

### Post Comment Page

##### Provided Req's

A logged out user can access a post page but should not be able to create, edit or delete comments.

When you are on the post comment page and you are logged in, there should be a form field at the top that allows users to create a new comment.  When the user submits the comment, the page should NOT refresh, but rather the page should dynamically refetch all the comments.

Comments do not need to be threaded, that is, a user cannot comment upon another person’s comment so that all comments are on the same level.  Comments should be sorted by old on top.  An example of a single level comment thread can be seen in this forum:

At this point, comments can just be plain text.  Do not worry about adding HTML, style, images, etc.

##### Projected Implementation

Logged out users will be able to view comments on a software/vulnerability's page. When logged in, a user could create, edit, and delete their own comments, but not those of another user.

The page will not refresh upon comment submission, and will dynamically refetch all the comments.

Comments will be sorted in chronological order, and not be threaded.

Comments will be plain text, styled by the front-end CSS.


### Editing/Deleting Posts and Comments

##### Provided Req's

When a user is logged in, they should see an additional button to edit or delete posts and comments.  This button should be visible ONLY to the user that created the post or comment.  When editing a post, you should re-use your create post form, but ensure that all the fields are properly filled out.  When you edit a comment, the text field should be replaced with a form field with the current text already existing.

If a post is deleted, all associated comments should be deleted as well.  If you try to access a page with a deleted post (say you stored the URL somewhere) you should be redirected back to the home page.  If a comment is deleted, there should be no reference to it anywhere.

##### Projected Implementation

When logged in, a user will be able to edit and delete comments they have made, but not those of another user. A user will not be able to delete a 'post', as they cannot make a post; they may only comment on a page generated from the NVD API's, and cannot create their own listing for a vulnerability or software. Should a user wish to add their own software, or submit a vulnerability for a software, they should do so through the appropriate channels with the NVD.

When editing a comment, the text-field will be replaced with a form-field, filled by the current text.
